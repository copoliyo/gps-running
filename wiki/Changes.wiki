Kristian Helkjaer Lassen  (Kristian Bisgaard Lassen before he got married) has put up the code for his plugin here at Google Code. Evry thing has it it time, even if we all wish that Kristian continue to maintain and develop plugins, everything has its time. Open sourcing the code lets everyone take over the maintenance. Right now, ST user gerhard has access rights to the code and has started to do some work with the plugins.

Not too far in the future, there will be a public beta release that should be working more or less as the the current releases. There is no prebuilt packages yet, but you can check out and build manually. 

===Changes===
  * Plugin settings are now stored in the ST file Preferences.System.xml file instead of in individual preferences.xml files. The plugin will currently try to parse the old settings file if no information is found in the Preferences.System.xml.
  * Plugins are adapted to .st2plugin format. The plugins were created before the format existed and required some changes to work. Note that most exceptions reported in the forums seem to occur when users have repackaged the plugins in .st2plugin format.
  * Works in Mono/Linux, except AccomulatedSummary that uses browser integration. There are no specific changes to achieve this, just the change of storage for preferneces was necessary.
  * Using the translation information built in to !SportTracks for common information like speed/pace etc. This decreases the job required to make translations, bothe for making the translations, but even more to handle the strings when building. Another benefit is that this makes the user experience more consistent (always the same format for something like km/h). Note that this information was not available in ST when the plugins were written, it has been added in a later update.
The drawback is that the plugins now handle speed/pace in the same way as the core program (km/h, min/km, mile/h, min/mile).
  * Documentation is just transferred from the old site at gpsrunning.nicolajsen.nl
  
===Bugfixes===
  * Elevation summaries in AccomulatedSummary were always in meters, not in the elevation unit settings.

===Future plans===
Gerhard currently drives development, the current job is to only minor changes to the functionality, just updating the structure. There will likely be more additions over time.

  * Active Lap info (at least in UniqueRoutes, maybe Overlay too).
  * Unique Routes "hints" to other plugins where matches were found.
This is for Overlay and DotRacing to match graphs better.
  * PerformancePredictor: Age tables?
  * UR, HS: Doubleclick on activity to go to it?

  * TRIMP plugin: No plans for it, I would like recommend users to use
Training Load instead.
  * Accumulated Summary: No immediate plans.

===Related plugins===
The Unique Routes plugin is integrated in other plugins.
MapOverlay/DotRacing should work without changes.
Matrix plugin requires a patch: http://matrix.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?DownloadId=102155
(I could put up a build if there are interest if there is no official release).

===Migration===
  * The old plugins under %ProgramFiles%\Zone Five Software\SportTracks 2.1\Plugins must be removed manually.
  * The settings files can be removed after first startup (but there is no harm keeping them if you delete the Preferences.System.xml file, without a backup).
