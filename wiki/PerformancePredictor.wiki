=What does it do?=
Ever wondered after running a killer race, how well you would perform at other distances. This plugin does this by using various models. So far the plugin implements the Dave Cameron and Pete Riegel models to predict your performance, but more models could be added. Note that the current models applies to Running only, not applicable for other types of activities.

The prediction models works better in some situations:
  * The distance used to base a prediction on must be comparable to the distance to predict for. So predicting a marathon from a 1km activity will be unreliable, but predicting a marathon from a half marathon is better.
  * You have to be trained for both the activity you base the prediction on and the distance you predict for. So you have to train for a marathon to predict it.
  * The models do not use the physiological effect often seen, that activities longer than 2h will be slower. So for instance to predict a marathon from a half marathon often give a little too optimistic result.

In all, the predictions are often considered a little too optimistic. Still, if you are interested in analysis of your best performances this sort of plugin should definitely  also be a part of your !SportTracks plugin setup.

=Models=
==Dave Cameron==
The Dave Cameron model works as follows:
[http://gps-running.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/plugins/performancepredictor/davecameron.png]

Here d<sub>old</sub> and t<sub>old</sub> both refer to the race you use as input to the model; i.e., the distance and time of the race. By selecting d<sub>new</sub> at various distances we can calculate the predicted time at these distances t<sub>new</sub>. 

==Pete Riegel==
Once you have understood the Dave Cameron model, it should be easy understand the Pete Riegel model as well:

==WAVA==
World Master Athletics ([http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/ WMA]), formerly known as the World Association of Veteran Athletes (WAVA) compiles statistics for results for a number of distances. The statistics are done in such way that 100% should be the same (or higher) than the world record for the sex, age and distance. 

The values can also be used to predict performances. If you perform at 60% of the world record at a certain age and distance, (with the usual reservations) many perform at 60% at other distances. The benefit of this model is that it takes into account that most runners loose speed before endurance. So for an older runner this model is often predicting better than the teorethical formulas. However all athletes are not aging the same way. See for instance [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_athletics#Age-graded_tables WikiPedia] for a discussion about limits.

=Training=
Besides predicting times the plugin also give suggestions regards to training. These suggestions are based on Jack Daniels's training philosophies. Currently, the plugin suggests training paces, pace for tempo races and interval split times.

=Extrapolation=
In addition to predicting other distances from a certain activity, the plugin can extrapolate data for the activity based on other types of data.

===Temperature===
Compensate for higher lower temperatures. Slightly described in [http://coachsci.sdsu.edu/csa/vol36/rushall1.htm Burton and Edholm 1969].

===Weight===
The Weight affects performance. Some discussions at  [http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/whats-your-ideal-weight Runners World]. However a too low weight will not improve the performance. The plugin will not present results lower than BMI 18.5 (if you have set your height correctly).

===Shoe===
Light shoes improves performance, some research by [http://runsmartproject.com/coaching/2012/02/06/how-much-does-shoe-weight-affect-performance/ Jack Daniels]. The ideal weight for a shoe is seldom zero, that value is speculative...

The default shoe weight is derived from the activity Equipment, the first device under 1 kg. Note that the plugin presents weight by shoe, so the equipment weight is divided by two.

===Age===
Extrapolate the result to other ages, to see how you could have performed as younger or may perform as older. The calculation uses the WAVA tables that also can be used for prediction.

===Ideal===
If the ideal conditions had occurred in your prime age... Your true personal best, when there is no other explanation. This tab has some assumptions

Something that is not included is Hills. This is included in Trails plugin, using Performance prediction integration.

Another factor is Wind. Some estimations can be done using Weather and Power plugins.

Note: It is possible to change both the actual ("activity") and ideal ("optimized") values. These values are then used for prediction, traing and extrapolation.

=How do I use it?=
The predictor works in two modes:
  * Single activity in [PerformancePredictor#Activity_Page Activity Page]. This uses the complete activity to predict other distances.
  * One or more activities from [PerformancePredictor#Activity_Page Activity Page] or [PerformancePredictor#Edit_menu Edit]. This mode uses High Score plugin to get the fastest parts, then scales them up to predict other distances.

The modes give slightly different results. For instance, if you want to use a half marathon to predict other distances, using a single activity in the [PerformancePredictor#Activity_Page Activity Page] uses the complete activity scaling up and down the distance to other distances. This is using the predictor formulas in the way they are designed for and gives most optimistic predictions for steady activities. Note though that the base activity and the distance to predict for should be similar. Using a 1km activity to predict a marathon is not reliable.

On the other hand, using many activities (select many activities or invoke the popup from the [PerformancePredictor#Edit_menu Edit], can be explicitly selected for single activities too) will get the fastest stretches from many activities to get the potentially most optimistic prediction. The distance to use is configurable, by default 40%. So by default to predict a 10km, HighScore plugin is used to get the fastest 4km, for a marathon the fastest 16.878km is used. The 4km is then scaled to 10km with the selected formula, and 16.9km to a marathon. In general, this gives more optimistic predictions for activities where the pace varies, it can be seen as "what would happen if the pace was steadier". For consistent performances though, the predictions are less optimistic than using 100% of a single activity.
If you click the table when several activities are used to predict, the activity and the corresponding used part of the activity is marked on the Route view.

Note: With Highscore prediction, the longest activity most be at least 40% (by default) of the longest distance to predict. So if no activity is at least 16.9 km, the plugin cannot predict a result and will display "No seed activity" in the table.

=Activity Page=
Go to the activity detail view and select the Performance Predictor plugin from the Analyze menu as shown [http://gps-running.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/plugins/performancepredictor/ActivityDetailView.png here].

The side bar can be hidden, use the title menu (the triangle).

Here is a couple of images of the plugin in action:

=Edit menu=

Select one or more activities in Daily Activity or Report View, go to the Analyze menu and select the "Performance Predictor with High Score" item. The information is the same as the Predictor View when invoked as an Activity Page.

=Settings=

It is possibe to add and remove the distances that the plugin use in its calculation by going to the settings panel for the Performance Predictor plugin as shown in this figure:

[http://gps-running.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/plugins/performancepredictor/Settings.png]

=Todo=
 * Extrapolation based on more scenarios:
  * Age
  * Hills - some done in Trails plugin
  * Elevation [http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=10507&PageNum=3 RunningTimes]. See Trails plugin for a solution.
  * "Best combined"
 * Set time/distance manually to get training pace etc
